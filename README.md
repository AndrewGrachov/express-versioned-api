# Express versioned api
a little example about "how I can do a versioned api with express and mongodb".

#What is it?

Another example among thousands of them! Keep'em coming! 
This is accumulation of several practices of doing node, including versioning, atomic work with mongodb, 
streaming array responses, many-to-many relationship, basic "smoke" integration tests with mocha, etc.

So enjoy.. If you found a bug, please open appropriate issue.

#So what should I do?

Install it. clone it with git and then run

```
npm install
```

You should also have mongo server up and running on 127.0.0.1:27017, otherwise you can change path in config.

To run tests, install mocha with

```
npm install mocha -g
```

and run 

```
npm test
```

Also. There ain't no better way of document things, than tests. You can find them under 'test' folder
